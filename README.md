## This mod alters existing pipes. You may need another mod to add new pipes, but vanilla pipes will suffice.

# What?
Parallel Piping allows pipes carrying different fluids to run in parallel, without connecting.
Please report any bugs here or on [github](https://github.com/protocol-1903/parallel-piping)

# Compatability
Should be compatible with most mods that adds unique pipes, if something breaks, let me know.

### Known compatibility:
- Pymods
- [RGB Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RGBPipes)
- [Color Coded Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/color-coded-pipes)
- [Flow Control](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flow%20Control)
- [Pipes Plus](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pipe_plus)

If you wish to add compatibility with a mod, talk to me on here or discord so we can sort it out.

## History
This is a variation of No Pipe Touching, based on the original implementation of [Incompatible Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/incompatible-pipes) by sticklord. I thought of this a while back when rebuilding the mod, and it's stuck with me ever since.

If you have a mod idea, let me know and I can look into it.
